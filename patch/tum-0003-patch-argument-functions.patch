Argument functions comprise a class of OpenCL API that are responsible for
providing pointers to device memory and constant values for use in device
computation. These need to be modified to ensure that any pointers provided
represent a host memory space rather than a device space.

An example of a function in this class is clSetKernelArg[5].

It is possible to take advantage of Multi2Sim's implementation and avoid the
need to modify these functions by carefully handling pointers in the buffer
functions.
