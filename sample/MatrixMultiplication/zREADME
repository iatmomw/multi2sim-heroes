MatrixMultiplication host program and device kernel for use with multi2sim simulations and native execution

Current Status:
* Thoroughly tested as correct for native execution
* Tested as correct for simulated execution up until the point that a kernel binary is loaded (I lack an environment to compile kernels at the moment)

To toggle between native and simulation targets two parameters must be changed.

Makefile:
Native - LIBS = $(N_LIBS)
Sim    - LIBS = $(S_LIBS)

src/MatrixMultiplication.c:
Native - #define NATIVE_EXECUTION
Sim    - /* #define NATIVE_EXECUTION */
